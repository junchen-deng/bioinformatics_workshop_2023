# Workshop P2 (20th May 2021). The first Python scripts.
  
### P2.1. Recap of the key concepts
Last week, we have learnt the key building blocks of a Python script:  
* **Variables:**  
  * Integer  
  * Float  
  * String   
  * Boolean  
* **Arrays:**  
  * List  
  * Dictionary  
* **Flow control tools:**
  * *for* loop  
  * *while* loop  
  * *if* statement  
  
&nbsp;  
These few building blocks can be combined into seriously sophisticated workflows!  
Let's see how that works!
&nbsp;  
  
### P2.2. Key components of a script
**A Python script typically has these four essential elements:**  
&nbsp;  
**1) A way of informing the operating system that the Python3 should be used to interpret the script**  
  * We can run the script by specifying `python set_of_instructions.txt` ...   
  * But probably a more universal way is making sure that the script starts with a line informing the operating system that the remainder of the file contents should be directed to and interpreted by Python:  
  `#! /usr/bin/env python`, and making the script executable: `chmod u+x script.py`.  
&nbsp;  
  
**2) A way of accepting input:**  
  * Asking the user for input data, for example: `name = input("Enter your name: ")`.  
  * Opening files indicated within the script, or provided as arguments at the time the script is run.
&nbsp;  
  
**3) Operations on input information**
&nbsp;  
    
**4) A way of providing output:**  
  * Printing information to standard output (screen): `print("Hello " + name + "!")`.  
  * Creating output files.  
&nbsp;  
  
By combining these elements together, we can write our first script --- `Hello.py`
```
#! /usr/bin/env python3
UserName = input("Enter your name: ")
USERNAME = UserName.upper()            # .upper() is a method that converts a string to uppercase
print("Hello " + USERNAME + "!")
```  
&nbsp;  
  
### P2.3. How to structure your workflow? Script 1. Reverse-complementing a user-provided nucleotide sequence!
  
We are going to work on the first practical case:  
**A script that will print a reverse-complement of a user-provided sequence.**  
Considerations?  What are the necessary steps - how to break up the job into manageable tasks?
&nbsp;   
> 1. Request the sequence from the user, save it as a String variable
> ```
> Input_seq = input("Type your sequence: ")
> ```  
>  
> 2. Provide the dictionary of complementary bases, such as:
> ```
> Complements = {'G': 'C', 'C': 'G', 'A': 'T', 'T': 'A', 'N': 'N'}
> ```
>  
> 3. While reading the input sequence backwards, compute the complement, and save it! There are many ways of doing this. Let's take small steps. First, reverse the sequence:
> ```
> Reversed_seq = Input_seq[::-1]
> ```  
> ... then create an empty Reverse_complement string:
> ```
> Reverse_complement = ""
> ```  
> ... then for each base of the reversed sequence, obtain the complement, and add it to the Reverse_complement string:
> ```
> for base in Reversed_seq:
>    compl_base = Complements[base]
>    Reverse_complement += compl_base
> ```
> 
> 4. Provide the final sequence to the user.
> ```
> print("Reverse complement: " + Reverse_complement)
> ```
>  
> 5. Once you verify that the script works, foolproof your script.   
> For example, the way we wrote it, it is going to break if we provide the sequence using small caps, or make it nonsensical ("A!B11Nhbfiudi1i93i$$"). In an anticipation of that, consider converting the input sequence into upper case (`.upper()` method), and verifying whether the bases in the sequence are all in the 'ACGTN' set!
> 
> 
> 6. Also, see if you can trim down your script.
> For example, rather than reversing the sequence and then looping through the bases of the resulting Reversed_sequence, we can read the original sequence backwards:
> ```
> for base in Input_seq[::-1]: ....
> ```
> Rather then computing, for each base, a complement and later adding that complement to the "Reverse_complement" sequence, we can immediately add the complement of each base.
> ```
> for base in Reversed_seq:
>    Reverse_complement += Complements[base]
> ```
  
&nbsp;   
  
The final script that I came up with is at [Scripts/RevCompl.py](Scripts/RevCompl.py). Remember that this is just one way of doing that job :)

### P2.4. HOMEWORK! Script 2. Compute basic statistics for a user-provided sequence!

For your homework, please write a script that would compute basic statistics for a user-provided sequence: length, count of Ns, and GC%.
